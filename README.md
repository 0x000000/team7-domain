## PeerStreet Hackathon 2020 — Domain Model

Our main idea was simple: we want to show that it's possible to separate
domain modal from implementation and maintain this model as the first-class project.
We created 3 repos connected:

1. **Domain model** (Protobuf 3 + Rake task to build Ruby gem and Js/Ts package): [0x000000/team7-domain](https://github.com/0x000000/team7-domain)
2. **Front-end** (Vue-cli + typescript): [Kaciaryna/team7-frontend](https://github.com/Kaciaryna/team7-frontend)
3. **Back-end** (Ruby + grpc): [0x000000/team7-backend](https://github.com/0x000000/team7-backend)

## Project Structure

This is an easy domain model built on top of the protobuf 3,
descriptions include four models (`User`, `Loan`, `Address`, and `WebClient`) and one definition for the grpc server (`LoanService`).

* `definitions/*` — the main folder for the proto models..
* `definitions/api/*` — descriptions for the `grpc` server interface.
* `templates` — folder for simple lib stubs: `templates/ruby` includes simple scaffold for the Ruby gem and
`templates/typescript` contains the stub for js package with ts bindings.
* `build/*` — autogenerated folder for final libs. Do not edit.
* `Rakefile` — the main script which creates libs based on `templates` and compiles proto files
 to create functional libs for target languages into the `build` folder.

### Setup

1. `$ brew install protobuf`
2. `$ brew install protoc-gen-grpc-web --ignore-dependencies`
3. `$ bundle && yarn`
4. `$ rake build:all` — to rebuild libs
